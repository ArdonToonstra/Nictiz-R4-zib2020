  <description value="Immunization can be defined as “Generating natural immunity against pathogens by means of vaccination (active immunization) or by administering immunoglobulins (passive immunization)”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Only the (administered and planned) vaccinations are included in this information model. Administering immunoglobulins is part of the medication overview. Vaccinations have lifelong relevance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most vaccinations are carried out in the Netherlands as part of the RVP (Rijksvaccinatieprogramma, National Immunisation Program). RVP information is especially important for children.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Vaccinations are also relevant for adult patients such as transplant patients, dialysis patients and patients with a post-splenectomy status. In addition, there are specific indications for the vaccination of risk groups, such as travelers, professionals who come into contact with blood or patients with wounds, weakened immune systems or heightened risk." />

      <comment value="The zib Vaccination is mapped to this ImmunizationRecommendation profile and a profile on Immunization (http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-Vaccination-event) to align with the intention of FHIR. All past vaccinations are covered using the Immunization profile, while all future vaccinations, including the advised vaccinations, are covered in this ImmunizationRecommendation profile. Both profiles contain the zib mappings, except for the Dose (NL-CM:11.1.4) and Administrator (NL-CM:11.1.6) concepts which are, based on their current definition, not suitable for future vaccinations. Therefore they have only been mapped to the Immunization profile.&#xA;&#xA;Please note that the ImmunizationRecommendation profile has been aligned as much as possible with the zib Vaccination by setting the cardinalities of `.recommendation` ,`.vaccineCode` and `.dateCriterion` to x..1. This results in the removal of the ability to exchange a vaccination schema. Moreover, ImmunizationRecommendation has more mandatory elements that are not represented in the zib, such as `.date` and `.recomendation.forecastStatus`. Implementers will need to take these requirements into account when implementing the future vaccinations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The zib centre has acknowledged that the Vaccination zib is currently ill-defined, especially concerning future vaccinations. Therefore the zib will be completely redesigned for a future release." />

      <comment value="Please note that `.dateCriterion.code` is made mandatory by FHIR to provide a classification of the date. For example, earliest date to give, latest date to give, etc. This seems to be functionally covered by the zib as well, however, within the VaccinationDate concept as can be read from the definition: &quot;_If a planned vaccination cannot be administered before a certain date, the date stated (vague or not) must indicate this._&quot;. In FHIR it is not possible to include this kind of information inside a DateTime datatype, but rather it is explicitly captured in the `.dateCriterion.code` element." />
