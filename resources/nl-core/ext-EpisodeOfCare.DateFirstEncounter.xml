  <description value="For episodes of care it can be relevant, and always is in general practitioner workflow, when the first encounter was that a problem/concern was discussed. You could try to get to that date by going through all encounters taking into account that the EpisodeOfCare might have evolved over time, but this extension provides a convenience method to avoid that." />
