  <purpose value="This element is used to indicate the profile of the target of the reference in cases when the Reference.type is not precise enough to determine the functional counterpart of the reference element. This may be used which ever of the other elements are populated (or not). In some cases, the profile of the target may be determined by inspection of the reference (e.g. a RESTful URL) or by resolving the target of the reference; if both the TargetProfile and a reference is provided, the reference SHALL resolve to a resource of the same TargetProfile as that specified." />
