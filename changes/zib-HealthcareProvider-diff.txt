- Organization.identifier is now sliced based on a pattern.
- Organization.type[DepartmentSpecialty] and Organization.type[OrganizationType] from 0..* to 0..1
- For Organization.type the slicing discriminator is changed from fixed system values to valueset binding.
- Removed comments on Organization.alias because it has no basis in the zib
- Added comments on the root to point out to the usage of Location resource and the Organization.partOf.
- Major change: use of Location resource
