* Added textual guidance on the root to guide usage of RelatedPerson versus Patient.
* Removed the role extension (http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-relatedperson-role) because RelatedPerson.relationship has changed from 0..1 to 0..1. The zib concept role is now mapped to a slice on relationship.
* Updated to new zib-NameInformation and zib-AddressInformation and zib-ContactInformation profiles.
