- Added extra comments on the history of the mapping in relation to v3
- Removed mapping to BRP
- Added guidance on adding a value to Address.line to duplicate the relevant information in case the extensions are not supported
- Renamed Address.line extensions to their functional counterparts
- Added a comment to line.extension:houseNumberLetter-houseNumberAddition on the possibility of a leading space not being parsed
- Added a constraint to line.extension:houseNumberIndication to restrict it to the values 'by' or 'to'
- Mapped AddressType to extension:addressType and added ConceptMaps to map AddressType to .use and .type to adhere to international use. However, extension:official was removed. AddressType code 'HP' is now mapped to .use 'home' and .type 'both'. This was done because of two reasons:
-- The notion to mark an address as 'official' seems to have its origin in the BRP, but is absent in the zib model.
-- The addition of extension:official seemed based on the rationale: "if implementers do not support the custom extension:addressType, you should be able to determine the AddressType by looking at .use, .type and custom extension:official". However, in this use case extension:official would probably also be not supported. By mapping 'HP' to .type 'both', all AddressType codes can be mapped to a combination of .type and .use.
