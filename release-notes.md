# Nictiz-R4-Zib2020 Release Notes

This document contains release notes per zib, indicating differences with their [STU3 versions](https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017/), deviations from the [profiling guidelines](https://informatiestandaarden.nictiz.nl/wiki/FHIR:V1.0_FHIR_Profiling_Guidelines_R4) and other points of interest.

## zib-ContactInformation
* zib ContactInformation is mapped onto two profiles: one for the concept TelephoneNumbers and one for the concept E-mailAddresses. Both are added to the hosting profile.
* Removed mapping guidance on the root comment of zib-ContactInformation-E-mailAddresses, as this is now straightforward.
* Simplified mapping guidance on the root comment of zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers, as this is now straightforward.
* `ContactPoint.system` has a fixed value for zib-ContactInformation-E-mailAddresses and a restricted ValueSet for zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers to implement only the relevant zib parts.
* `ContactPoint.use` has a restricted ValueSet in both profiles to implement only the relevant zib parts.
* The extension zib-ContactInformation-TelecomType, which replaced the generic code-specification extensions from release 2.x of the zib2017 package onwards, has been deprecated again in favor of code-specication, as the mapping is now much more straightforward.
* The element TelephoneNumbers/Comment was introduced. This is represented using the ext-Comment extension in the profile for TelephoneNumbers.
