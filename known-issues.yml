zib-ContactPerson:
  zib deviations:
    RelatedPerson.name:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the presence of the HumanName.use element. A full name can be broken into parts using multiple instances of HumanName that have its own value for use. Documented in the profile too.
      - datatype: HumanName
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    RelatedPerson.telecom:
      - short: ContactInformation
        reason: The element represents both the zib HealthcareProvider concept ContactInformation as well as the root concept of the zib ContactInformation, due to the way the latter is mapped onto two profiles. Conceptually this represents the same concept, hence short can simple be "ContactInformation".^M
    RelatedPerson.address:
      - datatype: Address
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
