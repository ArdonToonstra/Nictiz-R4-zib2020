  zib deviations:
    HumanName.extension:humannameAssemblyOrder.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    HumanName.family.extension:prefix.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    HumanName.family.extension:lastName.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    HumanName.family.extension:partnerPrefix.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.

    HumanName.prefix:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: prefix and suffix are mapped to the "titles" concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
    HumanName.suffix:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: prefix and suffix are mapped to the "titles" concept from the zib. There's a mismatch however in the way this information is represented in the zib and in FHIR. The mapping is documented in the profile.
