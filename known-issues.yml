zib-Encounter:
  zib deviations:
    Encounter.class:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: Encounter.class is manadatory by FHIR. The cardinality matches the cardinality of the zib, however, it does not match with the conceptual cardinality concept. This should not be a major problem.
    Encounter.participant:healthProfessional.individual:
      - cardinality: 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..*) and FHIR (0..1) is explained by the parent participant element that may exists 0..* times, thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Encounter.reasonReference:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing ContactReason container in FHIR. This container may exists 0..* times, thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: Reference
        reason: The datatype mismatch between the zib (string) and FHIR (Reference) is explained by an error in the zib. DeviatingResult is captured with a reference to the zib-LaboratoryTestResult instead of a string value as the zib 2020 incorrectly states. This will be fixed in a future version of the zib (https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1427).
    Encounter.location.location:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (1..1) is explained by the parent location element that is constraint to 0..1 to honour the zib maximum cardinality.
