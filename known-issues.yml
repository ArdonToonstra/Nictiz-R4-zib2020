zib-VisualAcuity:
  zib deviations:
    Observation.extension:visualAcuityMeasurementDevice.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension uses a cardinality of 1..1 on the value[x] element. However, the extension itself is added with a cardinality of 0..1.
    Observation.bodySite.extension:laterality.value[x]:
      - short: AnatomicalLocation
        reason: The zib implies a reference to AnatomicalLocation::Laterality, but actually references AnatomicalLocation. This leads to unexpected results. https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1442
      - datatype: CodeableConcept
        reason: The zib implies a reference to AnatomicalLocation::Laterality, but actually references AnatomicalLocation. This leads to unexpected results. https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/ZIB-1442
