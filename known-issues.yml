zib-TextResult:
  zib deviations:
    DiagnosticReport.code:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The cardinality of both zib and FHIR is 1..1, but because of conceptual cardinality 0..1 is expected in FHIR. Discussion on how to deal with this is ongoing in https://github.com/Nictiz/Nictiz-R4-zib2020/issues/45.
zib-TextResult-Media:
  zib deviations:
    Media.content:
      - datatype: Attachment
        reason: There are several different ways to add Encoded Data to a FHIR message. By mapping the ED datatype to Attachment, implementers can choose the preferred way (by reference, url or inline data).
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The use of the Media resource referenced in zib-TextResult DiagnosticReport.media.link is optional (0..*), but if the Media resource is used, Media.content should be present (1..1).

unmapped zib concepts:
  - NL-CM:13.2.5: TextResult.Procedure
    reason: The reference to zib-Procedure can only be added as a reference to zib-TextResult from zib-Procedure. Thus the mapping is added there.
