zib-FreedomRestrictingIntervention:
    zib overrides:
        Procedure.code:
            - cardinality: 1..1
              reason: Although the concept TypeOfIntervention should be interpreted as conceptual and thus optional, Procedure.code is required by FHIR -- it doesn't make much sense to communicate a Procedure without communicating _which_ procedure, and the same applies to a FreedomRestrictingIntervention (procedure).
