zib-SOAPReport:
  zib deviations:
    Observation.date:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The cardinality of FHIR is 1..1, where the zib (SOAPReportDateTime) is 0..1. In case of absent data, the profiling guidelines provide guidance.
    Observation.author:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The cardinality of FHIR is 1..1, where the zib (Author) is 0..1. In case of absent data, the profiling guidelines provide guidance.
    Observation.section:SOAPLine.code:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The cardinality of both zib (SOAPLineHeader) and FHIR is 1..1, but because of conceptual cardinality 0..1 is expected. In case of absent data, the profiling guidelines provide guidance.
