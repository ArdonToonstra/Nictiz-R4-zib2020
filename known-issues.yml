  ignored issues:
    StructureDefinition:
      - message: sd-pg-08
        reason: The profiling guidelines assume the dashes from the id are replaced by spaces. However, "E-mail" from the zib name introduces a dash that's not part of the id.
zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.system:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: Although TelecomType and NumberType are optional in the zib, ContactPoint.system is used to identify the TelephoneNumbers concept itself when this datatype is added to a profile. If only a telephone number is given without TelecomType and NumberType, this will fall in the default slice of the profile.
