zib-ContactInformation-E-mailAddresses:
  ignored issues:
    StructureDefinition:
      - message: sd-pg-08
        reason: The profiling guidelines assume the dashes from the id are replaced by spaces. However, "E-mail" from the zib name introduces a dash that's not part of the id.
zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.system:
      - short: TelecomType / NumberType
        reason: The mapping of the zib to FHIR is indirect; the _combination_ of ContactPoint.system and ContactPoint.use maps to the _combination_ of TelecomType and NumberType
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: Although TelecomType and NumberType are optional in the zib, ContactPoint.system is used to identify the TelephoneNumbers concept itself when this datatype is added to a profile. If only a telephone number is given without TelecomType and NumberType, this will fall in the default slice of the profile.
    ContactPoint.use:
      - short: TelecomType / NumberType
        reason: The mapping of the zib to FHIR is indirect; the _combination_ of ContactPoint.system and ContactPoint.use maps to the _combination_ of TelecomType and NumberType

zib-AddressInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberIndication.value[x]:
      - datatype: string
        reason: The mapping of zib AddressInformation on the FHIR Address datatype is the result of compatibility with HL7v3, which is the format that a lot of healthcare data in the Netherlands is stored in.  As a result of this, the zib HouseNumberIndication concept with CD datatype is mapped to a FHIR string datatype with a constraint added (the value can only be 'by' or 'to').
