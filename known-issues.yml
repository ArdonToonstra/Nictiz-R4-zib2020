ext-LanguageProficiency.CommunicationDetails:
  zib deviations:
    Extension.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..1
        reason: FHIR restricts Extension.value to a max cardinality of 0..1. To use it more than once, the extension should be added 0..* in the hosting element.

zib-AddressInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Address.line.extension:streetName.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    Address.line.extension:houseNumber.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberLetter-houseNumberAddition.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberIndication.value[x]:
      - datatype: string
        reason: The mapping of zib AddressInformation on the FHIR Address datatype is the result of compatibility with HL7v3, which is the format that a lot of healthcare data in the Netherlands is stored in.  As a result of this, the zib HouseNumberIndication concept with CD datatype is mapped to a FHIR string datatype with a constraint added (the value can only be 'by' or 'to').
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    Address.line.extension:additionalInformation.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.

zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.system:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: Although TelecomType and NumberType are optional in the zib, ContactPoint.system is used to identify the TelephoneNumbers concept itself when this datatype is added to a profile. If only a telephone number is given without TelecomType and NumberType, this will fall in the default slice of the profile.

zib-ContactPerson:
  zib deviations:
    RelatedPerson.name:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the presence of the HumanName.use element. A full name can be broken into parts using multiple instances of HumanName that have its own value for use. Documented in the profile too.
      - datatype: HumanName
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    RelatedPerson.address:
      - datatype: Address
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
    RelatedPerson.telecom:
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the containers TelephoneNumbers (0..*) and EmailAddresses (0..*) inside the ContactInformation model. The FHIR datatype ContactPoint does not have these containers.
    RelatedPerson.telecom:telephoneNumbers:
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.
    RelatedPerson.telecom:emailAddresses:
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource.

zib-HealthcareProvider:
  zib deviations:
    Location.address:
      - datatype: Address
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
      - cardinality: 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch with the zib (0..1 versus 0..*) is explained by the restriction of FHIR to limit the Location.address to a physical address while the zib allows for other types of addresses (e.g. a postal address). Other types of addresses than a physical address are given in Organization.address which is referenced by Location.managingOrganization. More documentation can be found at https://github.com/Nictiz/Nictiz-R4-zib2020/issues/38
    Location.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib part ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource. Because the FHIR profile for ContactInformation consits of two parts the rootconcept of the ContactInformation is mapped on .telecom.
    Location.telecom:telephoneNumbers:
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: See Location.telecom
    Location.telecom:emailAddresses:
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: See Location.telecom

zib-HealthProfessional-Practitioner:
  zib deviations:
    Practitioner.name:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the presence of the HumanName.use element. A full name can be broken into parts using multiple instances of HumanName that have its own value for use. Documented in the profile too.
      - datatype: HumanName
        reason: A name in FHIR is represented using the HumanName datatype, not as a separate resource.
    Practitioner.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib part ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource. Because the FHIR profile for ContactInformation consits of two parts the rootconcept of the ContactInformation is mapped on .telecom.
    Practitioner.telecom:telephoneNumbers:
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: See Practitioner.telecom
    Practitioner.telecom:emailAddresses:
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: See Practitioner.telecom
    Practitioner.address:
      - datatype: Address
        reason: An address in FHIR is represented using the Address datatype, not as a separate resource.
        
zib-HealthProfessional-PractitionerRole:
  zib deviations:
    PractitionerRole.telecom:
      - cardinality: 0..*
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..1) and FHIR (0..*) is explained by the missing root element of zib part ContactInformation in FHIR. Instead, the two containers of the zib (TelephoneNumbers and EmailAddresses), which both have a cardinality of 0..*, are mapped directly into the resource. Thereby still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
      - datatype: ContactPoint
        reason: ContactInformation in FHIR is represented using the ContactPoint datatype, not as a separate resource. Because the FHIR profile for ContactInformation consits of two parts the rootconcept of the ContactInformation is mapped on .telecom.
