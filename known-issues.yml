zib-TextResult:
  zib deviations:
    DiagnosticReport.code:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The cardinality of both zib and FHIR is 1..1, but because of conceptual cardinality 0..1 is expected. In case of absent data, the profiling guidelines provide guidance.
zib-TextResult-Media:
  zib deviations:
    Media.content:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The use of the Media resource referenced in zib-TextResult DiagnosticReport.media.link is optional (0..*), but if the Media resource is used, Media.content should be present (1..1).
