  zib deviations:
    Observation.extension:position.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension has a cardinality of 1..1 on the value[x] element. However, the extension itself is added with a cardinality of 0..1.
    Observation.note.text:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used element has a cardinality of 1..1 on the text element. However, the note parent element is added with a cardinality of 0..1.
      - datatype: markdown
        reason: Mapping zib datatype string to FHIR datatype markdown may lead to markdown syntax appearing in unexpected places when exporting or converting data, but no data will be modified or lost.
