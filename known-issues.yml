zib-AddressInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Address.line.extension:streetName.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    Address.line.extension:houseNumber.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberLetter-houseNumberAddition.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberIndication.value[x]:
      - datatype: string
        reason: The mapping of zib AddressInformation on the FHIR Address datatype is the result of compatibility with HL7v3, which is the format that a lot of healthcare data in the Netherlands is stored in.  As a result of this, the zib HouseNumberIndication concept with CD datatype is mapped to a FHIR string datatype with a constraint added (the value can only be 'by' or 'to').
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
    Address.line.extension:additionalInformation.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The used extension makes the value required (1..1), but the use of the extension itself is optional (0..1), effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.

zib-ContactInformation-TelephoneNumbers:
  zib deviations:
    ContactPoint.system:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: Although TelecomType and NumberType are optional in the zib, ContactPoint.system is used to identify the TelephoneNumbers concept itself when this datatype is added to a profile. If only a telephone number is given without TelecomType and NumberType, this will fall in the default slice of the profile.
