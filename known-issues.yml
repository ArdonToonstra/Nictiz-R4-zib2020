zib-AddressInformation:
  zib deviations:
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberLetter-houseNumberAddition.value[x]:
      - short: HouseNumberLetter / HouseNumberAddition
        reason: These two zib concepts are mapped on a single extension. Textual guidance has been provided in the profile on how to handle these two concepts.
    Address.line.extension:houseNumberIndication.value[x]:
      - datatype: string
        reason: The mapping of zib AddressInformation on the FHIR Address datatype is the result of compatibility with HL7v3, which is the format that a lot of healthcare data in the Netherlands is stored in.  As a result of this, the zib HouseNumberIndication concept with CD datatype is mapped to a FHIR string datatype with a constraint added (the value can only be 'by' or 'to').
