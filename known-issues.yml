zib-Problem:
  zib deviations:
    Condition.bodySite:
      - datatype: CodeableConcept
        reason: The referenced zib AnatomicalLocation is profiled on a datatype level and not a resource. Therefore it cannot be referenced, rather its concepts and constraints are added inline. This element conforms to the zib AnatomicalLocation.        
    Condition.note.text:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The mapped element has a cardinality of 1..1. However, the parent element .note, has a cardinality of 0..1, effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
