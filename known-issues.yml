zib-PharmaceuticalProduct:
  zib deviations:
    Medication.ingredient:
      - datatype: BackboneElement
        reason: The appropriate representation of ingredient in FHIR is Medication.ingredient. The container can be properly mapped to this BackboneElement.
    Medication.ingredient.strength:
      - datatype: Ratio
        reason: The `ingredient.strenght` acts as a container for the two child elements and can the be correclty mapped to the zib Concentration container. 
    Medication.ingredient.item[x]:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: There is a known cardinality mismatch between FHIR (1..1) and the zib (0..1) for the .ingredient.item element which is nested in the optional .ingredient container. This constraint was already in place for the STU3 profile. Moreover this does not seem to be a concern for the Medication Proces information standard will use this profile as they will make this element required in their dataset.
