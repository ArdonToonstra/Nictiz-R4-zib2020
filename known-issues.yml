zib-LivingSituation:
  zib deviations:
    Observation.component:homeAdaption.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..*) and FHIR (0..1) is explained by the parent participant element that may exists 0..* times, thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Observation.component:livingCondition.value[x]:
      - cardinality: 0..1
        reason: The cardinality mismatch between the zib (0..*) and FHIR (0..1) is explained by the parent participant element that may exists 0..* times, thereby this mapping is still honoring the cardinality requirements of the zib.
    Observation.note.text:
      - cardinality: 1..1
        reason: The mapped element has a cardinality of 1..1. However, the parent element, .note, has a cardinality of 0..1, effectively resulting a cardinality of 0..1 for this element.
